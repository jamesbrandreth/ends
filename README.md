# ends
Ends is a mapping project aimed at finding out what people actually call places in London.

The names on maps are often a bit prescriptive -- sometimes set by local government or by property developers.
In London, people often use their local tube station as a place name - even if it's not the official name of the area.

I was inspired by the [New York Time's map of New York Neighbourhoods](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/upshot/extremely-detailed-nyc-neighborhood-map.html)
to try to collect the names used

## Contributing
I'm anything but an expert web developer - so I'm very open to contributions. I'll try to look at any PRs.
I'd especially like to make the database/api a bit more efficient.
