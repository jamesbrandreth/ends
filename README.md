# ends
Ends is a mapping project aimed at finding out what people actualyl call places in London,
and where those areas begin and end as understood by people who actually live and work there.

I was inspired by the [New York Time's map of New York Neighbourhoods](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/upshot/extremely-detailed-nyc-neighborhood-map.html)
